Intro
-----
CryptoCraze is a free open source project derived from NovaCoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient X11-based crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of Bitcoin and NovaCoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake
help further advance the field of crypto-currency.

Setup
-----
After completing windows setup then run windows command line (cmd)
  cd daemon
  cryptocrazed

Grant access to cryptocrazed.exe in anti-virus and firewall
applications if necessary.

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall
or forward port 

18775 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  CryptoCraze works without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the CryptoCraze network.

Upgrade
-------
All you existing coins/transactions should be intact with the upgrade.
To upgrade first backup wallet
cryptocrazed backupwallet <destination_backup_file>
Then shutdown cryptocrazed by
cryptocrazed stop
Start up the new cryptocrazed.
